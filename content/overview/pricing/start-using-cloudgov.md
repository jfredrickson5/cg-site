cloud.gov services can only be purchased by federal government agencies. We hope to provide services to state and local agencies in the future. There are a number of different ways to start using cloud.gov.

## Purchase cloud.gov for your federal team

If you represent an agency that wants to use cloud.gov services, you can purchase an access package. cloud.gov offers a number of packages, depending on your team’s needs. You can [compare packages and rates]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md" >}}) to get a sense of the options. If you’re interested in a package for your team, contact us by filling out [our initial interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevZfuJ_4KE-MZlm9gttYfsXQp0PJL7OR6k6LbZ9XnFn-oA6g/viewform). We’ll contact you to schedule a followup conversation to discuss your team’s goals and needs, and how we can help.

cloud.gov services are sold through 18F, a federal digital consultancy housed within the [General Service Administration's Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/tts). 18F sells services to other agencies through the Interagency Agreement (“IAA”) process. Currently, processing an IAA takes an average of 6-8 weeks (we are working to make this faster). To learn more about the IAA process and the information that you need to begin the process, please visit [18F's primer on IAAs] (https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/primer.html).

## Try a limited-use sandbox account for free

A sandbox is a free, limited way to try cloud.gov so you can get a sense of how cloud.gov would work for the applications your team builds. Anyone with a U.S. federal government email address can sign up for a sandbox space on their own. [Learn more about sandboxes.]({{< relref "overview/pricing/free-limited-sandbox.md" >}})

## Work with an 18F team

18F teams that are working with agency partners use cloud.gov to develop and deploy applications, and the cost of using cloud.gov is included in the IAA for the entire engagement. If you’re interested in full-service delivery of a product or application, [contact 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/contact/). For example, [Every Kid in a Park](https://everykidinapark.gov/) (for the Department of the Interior) and [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) (for the Department of Education) were both developed and launched using cloud.gov.

## Use cloud.gov as a vendor for a federal government client

cloud.gov can be a building block for vendors and contractors that supply services to federal agencies. If you’re part of a vendor or contractor, you can submit proposals to agencies for services to be built on top of cloud.gov.

If you’re part of a vendor or contractor that already works with government agencies and you’re interested in using cloud.gov, ask your agency partners to evaluate this option.
